                analyser-px release 1.0

What is this?
-------------

Analyser-PX is a traffic capture, aggregation and classification tool. Our
goal is to classify the aggredated traffic into p2p applications. The
capture can be performed either online (via a native ethernet interface) or 
offline (previous captured in libpcap file format). The traffic is 
aggregated into flows of packets of any protocol (tcp, udp, icmp...) which
is finished after 64s of inactivity. The flows are classified using a
signature-matching classifier for the main p2p applications. More information
can be found in http://www.gprt.ufpe.br.


Requirements
------------

The current version of Analyser-PX has been tested on Linux 2.6 
with gcc 3.4.  We expect the software to work on most
other POSIX systems that we have not explicitly tested.

The following requirements are for optional features of Analyser-PX:

Monitoring a live interface requires ethernet cards and drivers (but
cards and drivers are not required for working with trace files).  The
Analyser-PX dos not upply the drivers.

Reading pcap (tcpdump) interfaces and files requires libpcap and <pcap.h>.
Like pcap, provides a packet filtering mechanism based on the BSD packet 
filter (BPF). Also write classified aggregated flow in a binary format 
that can be read with analyserpx_read example application. Require libpcap 0.6 
or later, or any version of libpcap with the file <pcap-int.h> installed. 
Libpcap can be obtained at http://www.tcpdump.org/.
